<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a second-year PhD student at the State Key Laboratory of Brain-Machine Intelligence, College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University under the supervision of [Asst. Prof. Sha Zhao](www.shazhao.net) and [Prof. Gang Pan](https://person.zju.edu.cn/gpan).

My research interests include machine learning, artificial intelligence and their applications in brain-computer interfaces. I am particularly focused on developing algorithms that can enhance the interaction between humans and machines, leveraging neural signals for more intuitive control.
